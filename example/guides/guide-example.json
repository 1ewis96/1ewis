Private Keys</h3><p>Each Bitcoin wallet contains private keys, which are used to sign transactions and provide mathematical proof that they came from the owner of the wallet.</p><h3>3. Mining</h3><p>Mining is the process by which new bitcoins are created and transactions are added to the blockchain. Miners use specialized hardware to solve complex mathematical problems, and when solved, they are rewarded with new bitcoins and transaction fees.</p>",
